// PROJECT 2 REPORT - TESSA ADAMS

1. https://tladams.github.io/project-2-343f22/
2. 
    1. My application allows the user to type in any single word (or small phrase) and retreive 
    multiple different formal definitions, as well as the word's part of speech, and several different
    Spanish translation.
    2. 
        a. deploy site --> my site is publically deployed on GitHub (link provided).
        b. is responsive --> I used media queries in order to re-format and re-size the page
           view once the browser max-width goes below 768px. 
        c. uses 2 different apis --> this app uses the Merriam-Webster Collegiate dictionary and
           the Merriam-Webster Spanish-English dictionary.
        d. has search --> this app has a search/input form where the use can type in any word they
           desire and get the results for their query from the apis.
        e. display results --> after the user enters a word and presses the entr key, the definitions and
           tranlations will appear and then clear and re-populate when the user presses the enters
           button again.
        f. results are filterable --> unfortunately this aspect was not so successful for me. I added
           buttons that change color when hovered over and when clicked, I also added functionalty 
           for the background color of the informational div elements when hovered over as well.
